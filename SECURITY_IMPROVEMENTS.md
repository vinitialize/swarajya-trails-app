# Security & UX Improvements for Swarajya Trails

## Overview
This document outlines the security and user experience improvements implemented to protect against API abuse while maintaining an excellent user experience for the Gemini-powered itinerary generation feature.

## üîí Security Features Implemented

### 1. Rate Limiting
- **Purpose**: Prevent excessive API calls that could result in large bills
- **Implementation**: 8 requests per 10-minute window per user session
- **User Experience**: Clear error messages when rate limit is exceeded, showing wait time
- **Technical Details**: In-memory rate limiter that tracks request timestamps

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Length Limits**: Maximum 500 characters per input to prevent extremely long prompts
- **Pattern Detection**: Blocks suspicious content including:
  - System prompts (`system`, `instruction`, `ignore`, `bypass`)
  - Security-related terms (`api`, `key`, `token`, `secret`, `password`)
  - Script injection attempts (`<script>`, `javascript:`, `data:`)
  - Template injection (`{{}}`, `${}`)
- **Sanitization**: Removes potentially harmful HTML/script characters
- **User Feedback**: Real-time validation with helpful error messages

### 3. Caching System
- **Purpose**: Reduce redundant API calls for similar requests
- **Duration**: 30-minute cache TTL (Time To Live)
- **Benefits**: 
  - Faster response times for repeat requests
  - Reduced API usage
  - Better user experience

## üéØ User Experience Enhancements

### 1. Smart Suggestion System
Instead of a free-text input that could be misused, users now have:

#### Quick Trip Ideas
- Pre-defined trip types like "Day trip near Pune", "Weekend getaway from Mumbai"
- Safe, curated suggestions that generate useful itineraries
- No risk of prompt injection or misuse

#### Popular Fort Suggestions
- 10 carefully selected popular forts in Maharashtra
- Shows difficulty level, region, and category for each fort
- Filtered based on user's current filter preferences
- Reduces cognitive load for users unfamiliar with fort names

### 2. Dual Input Mode
- **Suggestions Mode**: Guided experience with predefined options
- **Custom Mode**: Validated free-text input for advanced users
- **Smart Toggle**: Easy switching between modes

### 3. Enhanced Visual Feedback
- **Loading States**: Clear indicators during API calls
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages for rate limits and validation
- **Real-time Validation**: Character count and instant feedback
- **Security Notice**: Transparent communication about security measures

## üõ°Ô∏è Attack Prevention

### Prevented Attack Vectors
1. **Prompt Injection**: Input validation blocks system-level commands
2. **Template Injection**: Pattern detection prevents template syntax
3. **Rate Limit Abuse**: Time-based limits prevent excessive usage
4. **Script Injection**: HTML/script character sanitization
5. **Social Engineering**: Pattern detection for security-related terms

### Monitoring & Logging
- Rate limit violations are logged (console warnings)
- Suspicious input attempts are tracked
- Cache hit/miss ratios for optimization

## üìä Performance Impact

### Positive Impacts
- **Faster Responses**: 30-minute caching for popular requests
- **Reduced API Costs**: Rate limiting and caching prevent excessive calls
- **Better UX**: Suggestions reduce user decision paralysis

### Minimal Overhead
- **Client-side Validation**: No server round-trips for basic validation
- **In-memory Caching**: No external dependencies
- **Lightweight Rate Limiting**: Minimal memory footprint

## üöÄ Implementation Details

### Rate Limiter Class
```typescript
class RateLimiter {
    private requests: number[] = [];
    private readonly maxRequests: number = 8;
    private readonly timeWindow: number = 10 * 60 * 1000; // 10 minutes
    
    canMakeRequest(): boolean {
        // Remove old requests and check limits
    }
}
```

### Input Validator Class
```typescript
class InputValidator {
    private static readonly MAX_INPUT_LENGTH = 500;
    private static readonly SUSPICIOUS_PATTERNS = [
        /system|prompt|instruction|ignore|bypass/gi,
        // ... more patterns
    ];
    
    static validateAndSanitize(input: string): ValidationResult {
        // Validation and sanitization logic
    }
}
```

### Cache Implementation
```typescript
class SimpleCache {
    private cache = new Map<string, { data: any; timestamp: number }>();
    private readonly TTL = 30 * 60 * 1000; // 30 minutes
    
    get(key: string): any | null {
        // Cache retrieval with TTL checking
    }
}
```

## üîß Configuration

### Adjustable Parameters
- **Rate Limit**: Currently 8 requests per 10 minutes (easily configurable)
- **Cache TTL**: 30 minutes (can be adjusted based on usage patterns)
- **Input Length**: 500 characters maximum (can be modified)
- **Validation Patterns**: Easily extensible for new threat patterns

### Environment Considerations
- **Development**: More lenient rate limits for testing
- **Production**: Stricter limits to prevent abuse
- **Scaling**: Rate limiter can be replaced with Redis for multi-instance deployments

## üìà Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. **User Authentication**: Per-user rate limiting instead of session-based
2. **Analytics**: Track popular requests for better suggestions
3. **Admin Dashboard**: Monitor usage patterns and abuse attempts
4. **ML-based Validation**: More sophisticated prompt injection detection
5. **Progressive Rate Limits**: Trusted users get higher limits

### Integration Opportunities
1. **Backend Rate Limiting**: Server-side enforcement for additional security
2. **CDN Caching**: Cache responses at the edge for global users
3. **Abuse Reporting**: Allow users to report inappropriate content
4. **Content Moderation**: Additional filters for inappropriate requests

## üéØ Benefits Summary
